    <p>This method uses BCFtools [1] to call SNPs in a reference assembly.  It will first map short reads to this assembly using the "map reads to a reference sequence" app.</p>

    <p>The first step is to create a raw VCF file containing SNPs: <code>bcftools mpileup -a FMT/AD -B -d3000 -qMIN_MAPPING_QUALITY -Ou -f CONTIGS_FILE BAM_FILE | bcftools call --ploidy 1 -m -A > RAW_VCF_FILE</code></p>

    <p>This raw file is then filtered and variant data are output to the filtered VCF: <code>bcftools filter -s LowQual -e 'DP>MAX_DEPTH || DP<MIN_DEPTH' RAW_VCF_FILE | bcftools view -v snps > FILTERED_VCF_FILE</code></p>

    <p>This method also displays a figure showing the distribution of genotypes/strains across reads libraries, assuming each reads library represents a single metagenome sample.  In each sample, a major genotype/strain is defined as concatenated major alleles where DNA polymorphisms were detected. The left panel of the heatmap lists the reference alleles. The right panel lists the position/locus of a DNA polymorphism on the reference genome. A disagreement with the reference allele is highlighted corresponding to the mutation types (transitions to transversions), and an agreement is colored in grey.  The figure may be downloaded from the report.</p>

    <p>The version of BWA-MEM [1] used to map reads to the reference is from the Git repo at https://github.com/lh3/bwa.git, with commit hash 3ddd7b87d41f89a404d95f083fb37c369f70d783.</p>

    <p>The version of meta_decoder [2] used to make the figure is from the Git repo at https://github.com/caozhichongchong/meta_decoder.git, with the py3 branch and commit hash 192bb32b13b0d0b73cdea872602171d8b5032649.</p>

    <p>Meta_decoder in turn uses strainFinder version 1 [3], from the Git repo at https://bitbucket.org/yonatanf/strainfinder, with commit hash 720087d84b4998a0ab7308880e48249c184dd0c2.</p>

    <p>This method should create a Variants object to store the result.  However, because this object type is not yet available in KBase, this method creates a report on the SNPs instead.  The BAM file and filtered VCF file can be downloaded from the report.</p>
