            Reference assembly
        short-hint : |
            The reference assembly to which reads will be mapped.

    reads_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Reads to map
        short-hint : |
            These reads will be mapped to the reference assembly.

    <p>This method uses Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) to index a reference assembly, then align a set of short reads to it using the BWA-MEM algorithm.  A Sequence/Alignment Map object is created to store the result.
