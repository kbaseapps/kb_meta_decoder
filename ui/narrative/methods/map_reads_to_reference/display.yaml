        short-hint : |
            These reads will be mapped to the reference assembly.

description : |
    <p>This method uses Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) to index a reference assembly, then align a set of short reads to it using the BWA-MEM algorithm.  A Sequence/Alignment Map object should be created to store the result.  However, because this object type is not yet available in KBase, this method creates a report on the mapping instead.  The output BAM file can be downloaded from the report.</p>

    <p>The mapping is done using <code>bwa mem CONTIGS_FILE READS_FILE | samtools view -S -b > BAM_FILE</code></p>

    <p>The version of BWA-MEM used is from the Git repo at https://github.com/lh3/bwa.git, with commit hash 3ddd7b87d41f89a404d95f083fb37c369f70d783.</p>
