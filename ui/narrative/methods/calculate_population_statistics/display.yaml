    <p>This method uses meta_decoder to calculate population statistics in a set of strains inferred from mapping reads to a reference genome.

    <p>Meta_decoder maps a metagenome to reference genomes and infer the intraspecies strain-level diversity in a sample. It finds maximum likelihood estimates for the strain genotypes and the strain abundances. Based on the strain genotypes and abundances, it estimates can compares the strain-level diversity across metagenome samples by calculating the nucleotide diversity, allele frequency, Transition / Transversion ratio, SNP density, and other statistic measurements.
